     C_1 (1) is incompatible with the hexagonal Bravais lattice
     It is compatible with the 
     triclinic Bravais lattice; ibrav=   14

     You might want to change the Bravais lattice or to

     understand why the symmetries are wrong before continuing
     The point group or the Laue class are not used to reduce the number of 
     computed tensor components

     ibrav=0 or Bravais lattice not compatible with the point group.

     The code will not use symmetry.

     Cannot use the Laue class with ibrav=0, using laue=0

     I will use elastic constants with the form
     Laue class not programmed or ibrav=0 using C_i
